/*
Flex (Flexible Box Layout) is a CSS layout model that allows elements inside a container to automatically adjust their 
size and position to fit the available space.It provides an easy way to align, distribute, and reorder items along horizontal or vertical axes.

display → Activates the Flexbox layout model when set to "flex". 
Children become flex items and can be arranged along flexible rows or columns.

flex-direction → Determines the direction in which flex items are placed inside the container.
Values:
    row → Items go left to right (default).
    row-reverse → Items go right to left.
    column → Items go top to bottom.
    column-reverse → Items go bottom to top.

flex-wrap → Controls whether flex items should stay on one line or wrap onto multiple lines.
Values:
    nowrap → All items stay on one line, may overflow.
    wrap → Items wrap onto new lines from top to bottom.
    wrap-reverse → Items wrap onto new lines in reverse order (bottom to top).

justify-content → Aligns items horizontally along the main axis.
Values:
    flex-start → All items packed at the start (left/top depending on direction).
    flex-end → All items packed at the end.
    center → All items centered along the main axis.
    space-between → Equal gaps between items; no space at edges.
    space-around → Equal gaps around items; half-space at edges.
    space-evenly → Perfectly equal gaps between and around all items.

align-items → Aligns items vertically along the cross axis (within one line).
Values:
    stretch → (default) Items stretch to fill container height.
    flex-start → Items aligned to top (start) of cross axis.
    flex-end → Items aligned to bottom (end) of cross axis.
    center → Items vertically centered.
    baseline → Items aligned by their text baseline.

align-content → Aligns multiple rows (or columns) of flex items along the cross axis; works only if wrapping is enabled.
Values:
    stretch → (default) Lines stretch to fill remaining space.
    flex-start → All lines packed at the top/start of container.
    flex-end → All lines packed at the bottom/end.
    center → All lines centered vertically.
    space-between → Equal space between lines.
    space-around → Equal space around each line.
    space-evenly → Equal space between and around lines.
