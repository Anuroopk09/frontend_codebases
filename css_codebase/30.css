/* 
@keyframes – defines the stages of an animation with keyframes showing how CSS properties change over time.

animation-name – specifies the name of the @keyframes animation to apply.

animation-duration – sets how long one animation cycle takes. 
   → values: time in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms), e.g., 2s, 500ms.

animation-delay – defines the waiting time before the animation starts.
   → values: time in s or ms, e.g., 1s, 0.5s (can be negative to start midway).

animation-iteration-count – sets how many times the animation should repeat.
   → values: a number (e.g., 3) or infinite (for endless looping).

animation-direction – defines the direction of the animation on each cycle.
   → values:
       • normal – plays from start to end each time.
       • reverse – plays from end to start.
       • alternate – plays forward, then backward alternately.
       • alternate-reverse – plays backward first, then forward alternately.

animation-timing-function – defines the speed curve (acceleration/deceleration) of the animation.
   → values:
       • linear – constant speed.
       • ease – slow start, fast middle, slow end.
       • ease-in – slow start.
       • ease-out – slow end.
       • ease-in-out – slow start and end.
       • cubic-bezier(x1, y1, x2, y2) – custom speed curve.

animation-fill-mode – defines how styles are applied before and after animation execution.
   → values:
       • none – no styles applied outside the animation duration.
       • forwards – retains final state after animation ends.
       • backwards – applies initial state before animation starts.
       • both – applies both forwards and backwards behavior.

animation-play-state – controls whether the animation is running or paused.
   → values: running | paused.

animation – shorthand property that combines all of the above.
   → syntax: animation: name duration timing-function delay iteration-count direction fill-mode play-state;

Example:
animation: changecolor 3s ease-in-out 1s infinite alternate both;
