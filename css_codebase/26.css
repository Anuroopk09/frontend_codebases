/* 
float: 
   - Moves an element to the left or right side of its container, 
     allowing other inline content (like text or images) 
     to wrap around it.
   - It removes the element from the normal flow 
     but still keeps it inside the parent box.

clear: 
   - Prevents an element from being placed next to floated elements 
     on the specified side (left, right, or both).
   - Here, `clear: right;` ensures #img2 appears **below** 
     any right-floated elements (like #img1), 
     even though itâ€™s also floated to the right.
