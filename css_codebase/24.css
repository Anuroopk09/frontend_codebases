CSS POSITION PROPERTY

Definition:
position → Specifies how an element is positioned in the document and how its top, right, bottom, and left properties are applied.

Types of Positioning:

static
- Default position for all elements.
- Elements appear in normal document flow.
- top, right, bottom, left properties have no effect.

relative
- Element is positioned relative to its normal position.
- top, right, bottom, left move the element without affecting surrounding elements.

absolute
- Element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (not static).
- Removed from normal flow, and other elements act like it doesn’t exist.

fixed
- Element is positioned relative to the browser window.
- Stays fixed in place even when the page is scrolled.

sticky
- Element acts like relative until a certain scroll point, then becomes fixed.
- Useful for headers or navigation bars that stick to the top while scrolling.
